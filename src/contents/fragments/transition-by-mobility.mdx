A few days ago, I came across a [blog](https://mikefrost.net/people-somewhere-vs-people-anywhere/)
discussing the concept of Somewhere People vs Anywhere People. These terms were brought up in
_The Road toSomewhere: The populist Revolt and the Future of Politics_ by David Goodhart.

To explain the terms in a simple and concise way, Somewhere people are those who would have a hard time to
survive if they move to somewhere else. They usually have a strong connection to where they are from, not
just emotionally but often financially. Their sense of existence and living a life depends on the sense of
being a "local". Anywhere people are those who identify themselves through their titles and achievements.
Being a "local" or not isn't a big factor in defining who they are. They are more willing to move if they aren't happy
with where they live. A farmer from Texas and a youtuber who does tech reviews are totally opposite in terms
of their mobility hence each belongs to different groups. The topic is thoroughly discussed in Mike's blog [^1],
I'm not interested in continuing the discussion. Rather, I found this growing mobility on the each individual has
implicitly changed how we deal with conflicts.

What brought my attention to this issue is the documentary series [_The Last Dance_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(TV_series)>).
Like many NBA fans, I enjoyed every single frame for the sake of MJ's charisma. The part strikes me the most, oddly enough,
is that how leadership looked like before the explosion of social media and how people resolved conflicts whether
it's among teammates or between the players and the office. It's mentioned numerous times that MJ was pushy on
his teammates. With the fighting story between MJ and Steve Kerr, it's not hard to tell that MJ is not very likeable in
many people's eyes. The way he cursed at teammates, being intentionally mean to agitate people who lack of good performance,
these would not make him look nice given the social media presence if he were to play today. But they did came up
ways to resolve conflicts without avoiding it.

**Today, we choose to avoid conflicts**. Players will form a super team to chase a ring instead of
pushing teammates to make them better. With the extra mobility, people would switch teams or jobs if they
can't get along with their colleagues or managers. With this mobility, people would choose to detach themselves
from the place and move to somewhere else. With the presence of social medias, people are more afraid of causing
conflicts. We fear stories are spread and twisted. With the mobility to avoid conflicts, it makes less sense to
confront people. The cost just doesn't worth it.
